## Robot Configuration Parameters ##
  # Acceleration limit for x, y coordinate and rotation
  acc_lim_x: 1.2      
  acc_lim_theta: 1.6  

  # Velocity when robot is moving in staright line
  max_vel_trans:  0.8
  min_vel_trans:  0.0

  max_vel_x: 0.5 
  min_vel_x: 0.0   # Robot Doesn`t Go Back If This Parameter is Zero

  # Velocity when robot is rotating
  max_vel_theta: 1.4
  min_vel_theta: 0.0
  ## max_rot_vel : 0.3
  ## min_rot_vel : 0.0

## Goal Tolerance Parameters for each coordinate ##
  yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.1    # Tolerance in Radians for Controller in Yaw/Rotation when achieving its goal
  xy_goal_tolerance: 0.2      # Tolerance in Radians for Controller in x&y when achieving its goal
  latch_xy_goal_tolerance: false 
  # If goal tolerance is latched, if robot ever reaches the goal xy location it will simply
  # rotate in place, even if it ends up outside the goal tolerance while it is doing so

## Forward Simulation Parameters ##
  sim_time: 5.0               # Simulation trajectory time
  use_sim_time: true          # Time to make trajectory
                    # Defines the duration of the simulated trajectory. Larger value allow the planner to consider longer trajectories
                    # Too low value allows to pass narrow area and too high value not allows rapid rotation

  sim_granularity: 0.3        # Determines the distance between simulated trajectoy points  0.025 -> 0.1
                              # Smaller value allow for finer-grained trajectory evaluatuion but increases computation time

  vx_samples: 10              # Number of samples which find in x coordinate velocity space
  
  # Set not to generate Y direction cmd_vel
  vy_samples: 0.0
  max_vel_y: 0.0
  min_vel_y: 0.0
  acc_lim_y: 0.0 
  
  vth_samples: 20             # Number of samples which find in theta coordinate velocity space
  controller_frequency: 5.0      # 10 -> 5
  penalize_negative_x: true

## Trajectory Scoring Parameters (Trajectory Evalutation) ##
  path_distance_bias: 32.0        # This and goal_distance_bias affects how the DWA Planner evaluate trajectories 
  goal_distance_bias: 20.0        # Determine the costmap obstacle distance scale. As it small reduces the impact of obstacles
                                  # And larger value makes the planner more cautions
  
  occdist_scale: 0.02             # Scaling factor applied to the costmap obstacle distance. A smaller value reduces the impact of obstacles on the trajectory evluation
  forward_point_distance: 0.5     # 0.0
  stop_time_buffer: 10.0          # Additional time buffer added to the planned trajectory to account for stopping. It helps the robot to decelerate 
                                  # and come to a complete stop at the goal location
  scaling_speed: 0.25             # Speed at which the planner scales the velocities of the sampled trajectories. 
                                  # Higher value allows for faster scaling, while lower value makes the scaling more gradual
  max_scaling_factor: 0.2         # Maximum scaling factor that can be applied to the velocities of the sampled trajectories
                                  # Smaller value will result in slower maximum velocities

## Oscillation Prevention Parameters ##
  oscillation_reset_dist: 0.05    # Minimum distance that the robot need to travel in order to reset the oscillation detection.
                                  # If the robot`s position change distance samller than this threshshold, it indicates that the robot is osciilatng 
                                  # and planner needs to take action to break out of the oscillation

# Debugging
  publish_traj_pc : true          # Set Trajectory Debugging
  publish_cost_grid_pc: true      # Set costmap Debugging 
  
  holonomic_robot: false
